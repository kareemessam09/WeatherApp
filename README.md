# 🌦️ WeatherApp

Hello,

I've developed this Weather App by carefully following the requirements(without any third-party libraries). It provides real-time weather updates based on your location, with features like swipe-to-refresh, detailed weather info, offline support, and configuration changes. Built using Kotlin and MVVM architecture, the app aims to offer a smooth and user-friendly experience.

I hope you like it!
